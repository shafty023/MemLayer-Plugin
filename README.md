# MemLayer Plugins

A self-learning memory system for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli), and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) that enables persistent learning across task executions.
Must be used with [MemLayer](https://prociq.ai).

## Overview

MemLayer provides your AI agents with episodic memory capabilities, allowing them to:

- **Log task executions** as episodes with outcomes, errors, and context
- **Extract patterns** from past experiences, especially failures
- **Promote proven strategies** into reusable skills
- **Retrieve relevant context** before starting new tasks
- **Learn from mistakes** to avoid repeating them

## Installation

### One-Command Installers (curl)

Use these from the target project directory.

#### Gemini CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shafty023/MemLayer-Plugin/main/install-gemini.sh | bash
```

This installs the Gemini plugin and configures `memlayer` MCP in `.gemini/settings.json`.  
Then run `/mcp auth memlayer` in Gemini to complete MCP login.
By default, installer checkout ref is `main` (override with `MEMLAYER_REPO_REF`).

#### Claude Code

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shafty023/MemLayer-Plugin/main/install-claude.sh | bash
```

This adds the plugin marketplace, installs `memory@ProcIQ`, and configures the `memlayer` MCP server in Claude.

#### Codex CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shafty023/MemLayer-Plugin/main/install-codex.sh | bash
```

This installs the `memory-usage` skill into the current repo at `.agents/skills/memory-usage`, installs Codex repo hooks under `.codex/`, enables Codex hook support in `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/config.toml`, updates the current repo's `AGENTS.md`, configures MCP, and prints the `codex mcp login memlayer` step for you to run explicitly.
By default, installer checkout ref is `main` (override with `MEMLAYER_REPO_REF`).

### Claude Code

1. Add the marketplace to Claude Code:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add shafty023/MemLayer-Plugin
   ```

2. Install the memory plugin:
   ```
   /plugin install memory@ProcIQ
   ```

3. Configure the prociq MCP server with your API key (see [prociq.ai](https://prociq.ai) for setup)

For more details on plugin installation, see the [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### Gemini CLI

See the [Gemini Plugin Documentation](gemini/README.md) for installation and setup instructions.

### Codex CLI

See the [Codex Plugin Documentation](codex/README.md) for installation and setup instructions.

## Commands

### `/memory:audit [episodes|patterns|skills]`
Inspect the current state of the memory system. Shows statistics, recent episodes, high-confidence patterns, and skill inventory.

### `/memory:teach <lesson>`
Manually inject knowledge into the memory system without task execution.

```
/memory:teach When using Detox with animations, always add explicit waitFor timeouts of at least 5000ms
```

### `/memory:forget <episode-id|query>`
Remove specific episodes from memory. Can search by query or delete by ID.

## Core Concepts

### Episodes
Records of task execution containing:
- Task goal and approach taken
- Outcome (success/partial/failure)
- Error details if applicable
- Tools used and file patterns involved
- Importance score (0.0–1.0)

### Patterns
Derived learnings extracted from multiple episodes:
- Root cause analysis
- Recommended strategy
- Trigger conditions (errors, keywords, tools)

### Skills
Mature, high-confidence patterns promoted to reusable knowledge that gets surfaced when relevant tasks arise.

### Notes
Persistent freeform knowledge entries that never decay (unlike episodes):
- Recording important discoveries that shouldn't fade
- Documenting project-specific knowledge
- Manual teaching via `/memory:teach` command
- Reference material that should always be findable

### Consolidation
Automatic processing that:
- Clusters similar episodes
- Extracts patterns from failures
- Decays old/low-value episodes
- Promotes patterns to skills

## Memory Tools (MCP)

### Episode Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `prociq_log_episode` | Record task execution (async, non-blocking) |
| `prociq_retrieve_context` | Get relevant past experiences before a task |
| `prociq_search_episodes` | Search with filters (outcome, error_type, project) |
| `prociq_get_episode` | Retrieve full episode by ID |
| `prociq_search_episodes_full` | Semantic search returning full episodes |
| `prociq_forget_episodes` | Delete episodes permanently |
| `prociq_archive_episode` | Soft-delete episodes (reversible) |

### Note Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `prociq_log_note` | Store persistent freeform knowledge |
| `prociq_update_note` | Modify existing note |
| `prociq_get_note` | Retrieve note by ID |
| `prociq_search_notes` | Search notes by content or tags |
| `prociq_delete_note` | Remove note from storage |

### Pattern & Skill Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `prociq_search_patterns` | Search patterns with filters |
| `prociq_list_skills` | List all available skills |
| `prociq_get_skill_content` | Retrieve skill markdown by ID |

### System Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `prociq_get_memory_stats` | View memory health and statistics |
| `prociq_trigger_consolidation` | Manually run memory maintenance |

## Best Practices

### When to Log

**Do log:**
- Failures (always, before retrying)
- Non-obvious solutions requiring investigation
- First-time task types
- Recurring problem categories (config, debugging, integration)

**Don't log:**
- Trivial fixes (typos, missing imports)
- Routine CRUD operations
- Pure research/exploration tasks

### Importance Scoring

| Scenario | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Normal success | 0.2–0.3 |
| First-time task type | 0.5–0.6 |
| Learned something new | 0.7–0.8 |
| Critical discovery/failure | 0.9–1.0 |

### Critical Rule: Log Failures First

Always log a failure **before** retrying. This captures the exact error context that would otherwise be lost after a successful retry.

## How Hooks Work

1. **SessionStart** — Reminds Claude about available memory tools
2. **UserPromptSubmit** — Injects memory workflow into TodoWrite (check memory first, log outcome last)
3. **Stop** — Reminds Claude to log failures and suggests reflection
